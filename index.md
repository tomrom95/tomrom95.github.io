About Me
-->

<p>I'm Tommy Romano [pictured above in this beautifully candid picture] and thank you for visiting my site. I am currently a Junior at Duke University double majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and Computer Science. For the semester, I am studying abroad as an affiliate student of Computer Science at University College London.</p>
<p>I was always a very indecisive kid, but when I was introduced to the world of programming and electronics in high school, it did not take me very long to determine that this was my future. Computer science and engineering represent the perfect outlet for both my technical and imaginative side. And now, as a student in the field, a researcher and programmer in an ECE lab, a member of Duke's electric car team, and an active tinkerer, a small interest has become a major part of my life. You can find a lot of my projects on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tomrom95" class="regular-link" style="color: #ffffff"><span class="font-semibold">Github page</span></a>.</p>
<p>Yet, however involved I am in my studies, I do have a life outside of the digital world. In my spare time, I play cello and percussion, golf in the summer and ski in the winter. I even like to camp and backpack, because sometimes it's necessary for me to remove myself from my computer appendage.</p>
<p>If you would like to know more about me in a professional sense, you can look at my CV below.</p>
