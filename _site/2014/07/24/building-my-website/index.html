    <div class= "postContent">
      <p>This website (who's domain name will likely change from tomrom95.github.io to a custom name) was my first venture in to web development. I started out with Ruby and Ruby on Rails, thinking I would do a lot of back-end work. However, most of the RoR functionality was unnecessary if I wanted to build just a static site.</p>

<p>So, I turned to Jekyll, which is a simplestatic site generator supported by GitHub. Ruby was still involved somewhat, since Jekyll is a Ruby gem, but this approach was much more targeted towards what I was trying to accomplish. With Jekyll, I was able to get a simple version of the site up within a few days. Then, like always, I started to overdo it and delve into the world of Bootstrap templates. I finally found one, called Munter, which is a dynamic one page site for companies. I really liked the functionality so I decided to strip it down and make it more suitable for a personal blog. Most of the animation was given in the template, but I added a lot of tweaks to fix some errors in the template and format it to my liking. Originally, the Munter template had FancyBox used to view a portfolio, but I changed it up so that it would actually become the site of my blog posts.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy the site. I will keep adding improvements and functionality in the coming weeks.</p>
